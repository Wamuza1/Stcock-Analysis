# Stock-Analysis
Analyzing stocks market, financial data by using VBA in Excel.

# Overview of Project: 
In this project, we are helping Steve, whoâ€™s just graduated with his finance degree. His parents will be his first client and are passionate about green energy stocks. Steve asked us to help him evaluate the all green energy stocks and DAQ stocks that his parents had planned to invest. 
Steve loved the workbook we prepared for him. He wants us to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although our code works well for dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. Also, it may take a long time to execute. 
This project aims to edit or refactor the code to loop through all the data one time to collect the same information that we have already prepared for him in this project. Then, we determined whether refactoring code successfully made the VBA script for optimization. Using code to automate analyses allows Steve to reuse it with any stocks and reduces the chance of accidents, errors, and runtime.
# Results: 
## Stock performance between 2017 and 2018.
First, we created a VBA script for 2017 stocks where all the stocks had positive return except TERP. Moreover, DQ return percentage was at the third place where Steve parents are interested to invest.

Next, we created the VBA script for 2018 to further explore the stocks to see the difference in Return and Total Daily Volume between the two years. We can observe that RUN stocks had a significantly high Total Daily Volume and return in 2018 compared to 2017, which were still positive. The ENPH, Total Daily Volume increased, and the Return percentage slightly dropped, still had positive results.
